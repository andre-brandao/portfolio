"Maze Defense" is a Unity-based game developed for my TI-5 class at PUC-MG. This game draws inspiration from the 'Tower Defense' genre, but with a unique twist: instead of using towers, players must strategically manipulate path intersections and control gates to guide enemies into specific traps tailored to defeat particular types of mobs.

Some of the game art was made by me, but some assets were taken from the Unity Asset Store.

The game was developed using Unity and C#.
